# EdNoteAI Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files:

## Required Icons
- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (for toolbar)
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels (for options page)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (for extension management)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (for Chrome Web Store)

## Design Guidelines
- Use the EdNoteAI brand colors (blue/purple gradient)
- Include a microphone or note-taking symbol
- Ensure visibility on both light and dark backgrounds
- Follow Chrome extension icon best practices

## Temporary Solution
For development, you can:
1. Create simple colored PNG files with the required dimensions
2. Use an online icon generator
3. Extract icons from the main EdNoteAI web app
4. Use placeholder icons from Chrome's developer examples

## Production
Before publishing to Chrome Web Store, replace with professional icons that match EdNoteAI branding.
